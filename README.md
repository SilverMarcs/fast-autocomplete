# fast-autocomplete

A simple frontend that connects with a backend to provide an efficient Autocomplete Suggestion System.
This is similar to ones we have on our phones.

A demo is available [here](https://fast-autocomplete.vercel.app)

## Running locally

```git clone https://github.com/SilverMarcs/fast-autocomplete.git```

- Move to server folder <br>

```cd server```

- Install django using pip <br>

```pip install django```
or
```python -m pip install django```

- Start the server. If it complains about missing package/dependency, simply instal via pip <br>

```python manage.py runserver```
